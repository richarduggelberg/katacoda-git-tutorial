# Getting started

To get started with git, we have to do two things, first of all let's go ahead and configure git with our name and email. This is to identify who has done what on github.

```
git config --global user.name "Hugh Jass"
git config --global user.email hjass@aol.com
```{{execute}}

(naturally, if you're doing this on your local machine then you might already hade this config stuff done)

Secondly, we need to create a local repository, we can do that by running the init command.  `git init`{{execute}}

Great! You're well on your way to become the person everyone asks for help with untangling their git-commit-hell at work. :)
