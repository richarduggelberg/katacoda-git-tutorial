# Pull Request

This is the moment you've been waiting for, to make a pull request.

This is were you tell the owner of the original reposity that you forked from that you would like them to merge your changes into their repository. You could say that you send them a  *request* to *pull* the your work. Whether or not they will accept, or even write back, is another question. They might not even know who you are. 

#### Yeah yeah, how do I do it?

As we've mention before, this is an operation performed on github. That means you're not going to be able to do it here in this tutorial. Sorry. Anyway, how you do it is quite simple. 

1. Go to the original repository (on github) from which you forked.
2. Go to the tab that says "Pull requests"
3. Click the big, friendly, green button that says "New pull request".
4. Now, find the text that says "compare across forks" as part of the sentence right underneath the large "Comparing changes". Click that.
5. Now it should say something like this:
    > base repository: <owner>/<repo-name> base:<branch> <--- head repository:<your-name>/<repo-name> compare:<branch>
6. Create pull request and write something nice about it so that the owner knows what you (at least tried to ) accomplish.

### Congratulations! You did it!

That is, if you followed this guide beyond what katacoda let's us do.
Either way, now you know how it's done. Go be useful ;)
