# Cloning

The cloning command is awesome, not only does it get the repository, it also sets up the remote tracking for all of the branches. The syntax is:



git clone <repository url>

We are going to use the clone command to get our newly forked repo:

git clone https://github.com/richarduggelberg/katacoda-tutorial.git

Now what are some of the things that could go wrong? If you’re on a new machine and you haven’t authenticated yourself with github, you’re bound to get an error message stating:

“Fatal: Authentication Failed for: <repository url>”

Authentication is outside the scope of this tutorial, however, feel free to check out this awesome guide!
