# Thanks for participating!

This has been a git tutorial by Pojan Shahrivar and Richard Uggelberg.

Hope you learned something or at least wasn't bored out of your mind.

## Using this in the "real world"

Everything in this tutorial should work in the real work too. After all, that's the point. Simply replace the example repositories and branches with the real thing. 

## Remember, when all else fails, you can always just give up


```sh
cd ..
sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
cd fucking-git-repo-dir
```

##### Or in other words ...
1. exit repo
2. remove repo
3. clone repo again
4. enter repo

## Disclaimer

We are not experts at either Git, Open-source workflow or Software Engineering. This is a compilation of things we've learned the hard way through working with git repositories and getting frustrated in the process. We aim simply give an example of a streamlined workflow that should work for most people when contributing to open-source.
