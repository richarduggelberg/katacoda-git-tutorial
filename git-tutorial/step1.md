First of all ... 

# What is Git?

Yes, you probably already know. Or, at least, think you know. We're going to explain it anyway. Please don't leave.

Git is a distributed version-control system specifically made for software development. It tracks changes made to files and helps programmers coordinate their work. 

It was created by Linus Torvalds back in 2005 in order to help working on the linux kernel. It is distributed in the sense that every directory on every computer is a repository that has the complete history and tracking abilities indepented of access to a central server. Git is free and open-source.

# What is GitHub?

Ah, an important distinction. While learning this stuff, newcomers might confuse the two since they're so often used in conjunction. Simply put, GitHub is a hub for git. A cloud-based platfrom based around the git tool. Things like add, commit, log and so on are git commands while forks and pull requests are GitHub operations. 

## Anyway, let's get started!
