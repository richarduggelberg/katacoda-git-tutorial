# Git Tutorial

By Pojan Shahrivar and Richard Uggelberg

## Outline

You will be taken through the entire process of contributing to an open-source project. 

#### Note on GitHub functionality in this tutorial

In order to allow the user to go through the entire tutorial without a local environment setup there are some minor issues that have to be addressed. Example repositories have been set up to simulate a target repository at different stages of development. This means, though, that GitHub operations such as Fork and Push cannot be done. However, simply imagine that the repository that we clone is the forked repository. Furthermore, this is where we would push the code and later make a pull request to the owner of the original repository.
