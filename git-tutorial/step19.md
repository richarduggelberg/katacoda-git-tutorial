# Push!

Run the following command to push what you've done to the master branch of your fork!

```git
git push origin master
```{{execute}}

No wait, hang on, this is where we run into trouble with the whole "this is actually just a drill" thing. 

Anyway, if this was for real. You'd be able to do just this. I promise.
